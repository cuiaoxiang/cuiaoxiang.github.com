I used to study mathematics and got a Phd in 2011. My major is [Algebraic geometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry).
Now I'm working as a full time engineer at Google Shanghai. The working language is Java.

I like to watch movie, American/Japan TV series, play table tennis and swimming.

This blog will be served as
* notes of my studies and reflections
* the record of my life
* motivation to write something
* my spiritual sanctuary
